# FPGA Computer Vision (CV)

**FPGA-CV** - my personal approach for Image/Video processing on FPGA. The main motivation is to bring back my PhD project back to life while learning new stuff. 

*Motivation:*
- Resurrect my project [Hardware architectures for infrared pedestrian detection systems](https://www.napier.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/research-search/outputs/hardware-architectures-for-infrared-pedestrian-detection-systems#downloads)
- Brush up my RTL development skills
- Learn new stuff
- Teach others

*Objectives:*
- use open source tools
   - [Icarus Verilog simulator](http://iverilog.icarus.com/)
   - [Verilator HDL simulator](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator)
   - [Cocotb](https://cocotb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 - move out from my comfort zone to
   - Python 3
   - Intel FPGA

*Goals:*
- Create an open framework for FPGA image processing
- Develop a "go-to-platform" for FPGA-CV projects
- To see this again - real-time video capture into the FPGA, segmentation, classification and tracking, all on the output monitor!
